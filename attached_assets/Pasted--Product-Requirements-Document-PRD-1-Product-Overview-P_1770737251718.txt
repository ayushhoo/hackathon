# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview

**Product Name:** van sampatti
**Product Type:** Data-driven environmental monitoring and restoration platform with a public-facing website

**Vision:**
To enable real-time, data-informed restoration and management of riparian zones using scalable sensing infrastructure, AI-driven analytics, and community engagement.

**Mission:**
Empower environmental stakeholders with precise, real-time insights and predictive tools to combat riparian degradation, deforestation, runoff, and habitat disruption.
